# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book. This module explores digital twin technology using Gazebo and Unity, which allows you to simulate and test humanoid robots in virtual environments.

## Overview

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that enables real-time monitoring, simulation, and analysis. In robotics, digital twins are crucial for testing algorithms, validating control systems, and training AI models before deployment on physical robots.

In this module, you'll learn:
- The principles of digital twin technology in robotics
- Setting up simulation environments with Gazebo
- Creating humanoid robot models for simulation
- Integrating Unity for advanced visualization
- Validating robot behaviors in simulation before real-world deployment

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of 3D modeling concepts
- Familiarity with simulation concepts

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
1. Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments for humanoid robots
2. Create accurate digital twin models of physical robots
3. Implement physics-based simulations for robot validation
4. Use Unity for advanced visualization and human-in-the-loop testing
5. Validate robot control algorithms in simulation before physical deployment

## Next Steps

In the following sections, we'll explore Gazebo simulation setup and learn how to create your first digital twin of a humanoid robot.
