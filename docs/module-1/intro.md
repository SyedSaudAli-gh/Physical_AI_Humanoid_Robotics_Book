# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book. This module introduces you to the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system for humanoid robots.

## Overview

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

In this module, you'll learn:
- The fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture
- How to create and run ROS 2 nodes
- Communication patterns: topics, services, and actions
- Building ROS 2 packages with Python
- How ROS 2 applies to humanoid robot control

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
1. Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 and its role in humanoid robotics
2. Create and run ROS 2 nodes that communicate using topics, services, and actions
3. Build ROS 2 packages with Python for humanoid robot control
4. Read, edit, and visualize humanoid robot URDF files
5. Integrate simple Python agents with ROS 2 via rclpy

## Next Steps

In the following sections, we'll dive deep into ROS 2 fundamentals, starting with understanding nodes - the basic building blocks of any ROS 2 application.
